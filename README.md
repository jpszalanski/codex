This repository contains a sample iOS application to manage a smart plant pot.
The project `SmartPlantPotApp` demonstrates a simple SwiftUI interface that
allows:

- Basic login screen (no real authentication logic implemented).
- Listing and adding plants with optional photo-based identification (stubbed).
- Managing locations for plants (rooms, office, etc.).
- Viewing plant details with current sensor values compared to ideal ranges.

The app includes placeholder areas where integration with the ChatGPT API and
sensor devices should be implemented.
